# Re-former

> This is the third Ruby on Rails project; here we have to create an HTML form from scratch in order to know how rails interact and change the traditional form until we get to a railish full created form known as a helper form which includes all normal form's attributes and handy ways to save lines of code and time, concluding that using the rails form helper is much better and practical since is recommended as the best rails practices.
